##The K-mean algrithm,

Choose K points as the initial centroid

repeat
  Form K clusters by assigning all points to the closest centroid
  Recompute the centroid of each cluster.
Stop when the centroids don't change any longer.

#Tuning K-Means

##Solutions to intitial centroid problems

Perform multiple runs, changing random seeds every time. Helps but probability is not on your side. 
Sample and use hierarchical cluster to determine initial centroids
Select more than k initial centroids and then select amount
Select the most widely spread

##Compare the SSE of Different Initial Centroids

Most common measure is the sum of squared error (SSE)
x is a data point in cluster Ci and mi is the centroid or medoid for Cluster Ci

For each point, the error is the distance to centroid or Medoid. To get SSE, we square these errors and sume them.
